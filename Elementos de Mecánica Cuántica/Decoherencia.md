QEC book:
"decoherence can often be characterized by a few simple time scales: commonly T1 (the thermalization time scale) and T2 (the dephasing time scale). On a less simplified basis, one can try to determine an exact mathematical description of the quantum evolution, including the effects of noise, by quantum process tomography."
