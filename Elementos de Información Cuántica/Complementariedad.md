Hidden-Variables theories.

Complementariedad:
_The results of experiments designed to probe different aspects of a quantum system are complementary to one another in the sense that only the totality of the potentially observable attributes exhausts the possible information that may be obtained about the system._[^2]

_particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways_[^1]

_The multi-qubit relations which we derive imply that quantum mechanical systems possess the unique ability to encode information directly in entangled correlations, without the need for the correlated subsystems to possess physically meaningful values._[^2]

_We present a local hidden-variable model supplemented by an efficient amount of classical communication that reproduces the quantum-mechanical predictions for the entire class of Gottesman-Knill circuits._[^2]
